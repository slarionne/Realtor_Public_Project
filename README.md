# Realtor Public Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Realtor Public Project! This repository showcases my work in analyzing real estate data extracted from realtor.com. The primary objective was to leverage data science techniques to gain insights into the real estate market and develop a predictive model for property prices. This project has been made public to demonstrate my skills and contributions in the field.

## Key Features
Data Extraction and API Connectivity
I connected to the realtor.com API to extract comprehensive real estate data. Initially, I explored one endpoint but discovered an opportunity to enhance my dataset by looping through a different endpoint. However, after thorough analysis, it was determined that the additional data did not significantly contribute to the overall analysis.

## Data Analysis and Transformation
The project involved a detailed analysis of the acquired data. I performed various transformations, including the creation of new columns derived from existing data to enrich the dataset. These transformations aimed to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the real estate market.

## Machine Learning Model
To predict property prices, I implemented a machine learning algorithm using Random Forest Regression. A pipeline was utilized to run multiple algorithms, comparing their performance and selecting the Random Forest model as the most accurate. This step enhances the project's predictive capabilities, offering valuable insights for stakeholders.

## Integration of Rental Data
In the pursuit of a holistic understanding of the real estate landscape, I explored rental data. I considered ways to incorporate this information into the existing model or potentially develop a separate model specifically for rental predictions.

## Streamlit Dashboard
To facilitate interactive exploration of the data and showcase model predictions, I utilized Streamlit to create a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard serves as a visual representation of the project's findings, providing an overview of the real estate data and presenting output predictions in an accessible manner.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the codebase and documentation. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. This project serves as a testament to my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and the creation of insightful data visualizations.

Thank you for visiting the Realtor Public Project!
